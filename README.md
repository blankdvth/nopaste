# Custom Fork of [NoPaste](https://github.com/bokub/nopaste)
A custom fork of nopaste with various enhancements, changes, and additions for my own use. Thanks to [MSWS](https://github.com/MSWS) for a lot of the initial work towards these features.

## Added Features
- Simplified buttons
- Added search w/ regex search (`Ctrl + F`: Persistent, `Alt + F`: Single)
- Added replace w/ regex matches \[`$MATCHNUM`] (`Ctrl + Shift + F`: Replace, `Ctrl + Shift + R`: Replace All)
- Added support for GitHub Gists (`https://nopaste.blankdvth.com/#gist/<GISTID>`)
- Added support for my own Hastebin instance (`https://nopaste.blankdvth.com/#haste/<HASTESLUG>`)
- Added support for other raw content by URL (`https://nopaste.blankdvth.com/#url/<URL>`). Will likely fail as a result of CORS for most sites.
- Custom syntax highlighting
- Added words to footer
- Updated sorting of languages
